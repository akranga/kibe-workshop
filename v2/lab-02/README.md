# Lab 02 Cuztomized Appplication Deployment

## Introduction

In the second lab we are going to slightly modify our application. In order to do that we need to 
* do few modifications in the source code of the applications 
* build new docker images, that contain these changes
* push these images to a Docker registry
* deploy applications to Kubernetes

We are going to push images to a private docker registry (Harbor) and authorize Kubernetes cluster to pull images from this registry. 

## Modify the DB application

Let's make our application to build sentences from Latvian words instead of English words!
In order to do so we need to modify a SQL script that inserts data (words) to application's database.
